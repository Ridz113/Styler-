# Styler-
A Final Year Project I made for Bachelors Course at the University of Birmingham. Its a website that aggregates different clothing products from different retail stores and allows users to add them to their virtual wardrobe. They can then cycle through the clothing items and create an outfit of their choice buying it from the respestive store.
